# Which-hospital-in-Ahmedabad-offers-advanced-cancer-surgery-for-international-patients-

Ahmedabad has become a hub for medical tourism, especially for cancer care. Many international patients from Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia come here every year for high-quality but affordable treatment.

One such place known for advanced cancer surgery and care for international patients is Dr. Nitin Singhalâ€™s center. He is a senior surgical oncologist trained at Tata Memorial, Mumbai, and has treated many overseas patients with complex cancers.

His hospital setup offers:

Robotic surgery systems

HIPEC for abdominal cancers

Multidisciplinary cancer care

Help with medical visas, stay, and travel

Personalized second opinions via video before traveling

What patients really like is the clear communication, safe environment, and honest approach. The hospital also supports translators and visa assistance to make the entire process smoother for foreigners.

Whether itâ€™s for colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, or prostate cancer, international patients can expect world-class treatment hereâ€”at a cost thatâ€™s far lower than the US or UK.
